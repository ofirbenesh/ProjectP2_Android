Android facebook project:<br>
we started with planing the sign up and login pages.<br>
than programming the activities and xml designs for each one.<br>
to sign up user must fill all fields. the passwords must match and contatin 8-16 letters, capitals and lowers and numbers in english.<br>
all of this is being validated in sign up. <br>
after sign up, the user is required to use the same user name and password he sign up with in order to log in.<br>
in the feed you can view posts from Json File and add and delete your own posts, and like and comment on others.<br>

the app runs on Android studio.<br>
